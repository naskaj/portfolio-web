                    <p>
                        I am a fresh graduate of Computer Engineering University of Brawijaya
                        who is interested in AIoT and web development. I have a good understanding
                        of technology and computing, as well as a willingness to learn new things.
                        I have done several projects during college years which have helped me gain
                        relevant experience in microcomputers and machine learning. I currently
                        actively learning about software development by trying and joining mini courses.
                        I am committed to improve my knowledge and skills to create technology
                        solutions that satisfy users.
